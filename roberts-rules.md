Simplified Roberts Rules of Order
==

Preamble
--

* Everyone has the right to speak once if they wish, before anyone may speak a second time.
* Everyone has the right to know what is going on at all times.  -
* Only urgent matters may interrupt a speaker.  +
* The members discuss only one thing at a time.  +

Procedure
--

1. **You want to bring up a new idea before the group.** After recognition by the chair, present your motion. A second is required for the motion to go to the floor for debate or consideration.  +
2. **You want a motion just introduced by another person to be killed.** Without recognition from the chair simply state *"I object to consideration."* This must be done before any debate. This motion requires no second, is not debatable, and requires a 2/3 supermajority vote.  +
3. **You want to change some of the wording in a motion under debate.** After recognition by the chair, move to amend by:
 1. adding words
 2. striking words
 3. striking and inserting words  +
4. **You like the idea of a motion under debate, but you need to reword it beyond simpleword changes.** Move to substitute your motion for the original motion. If it is seconded, debate will continue on both motions and eventually the body will vote on which motion they prefer.  +
5. **You want more study and/or investigation given to the idea under debate.** Move to refer to a committee. Try to be specific as to the charge to the committee.  +
6. **You want more time personally to study the proposal under debate.** Move to postpone to a definite time or date.  +
7. **You are tired of the current debate.** Move to limit debate to a set period of time or to a set number of speakers. Requires a supermajority.  +
8. **You have heard enough debate.** Move to close the debate. Requires a supermajority. Or move to previous question. This cuts off debate and brings the assembly to a vote on the pending question only. Requires a supermajority.  +
9. **You want to postpone a motion until some later time.Move to table the motion.** The motion may be taken from the table after one item of business has been conducted. If the motion is not taken from the table by the end of the next meeting, it is dead. To kill a motion at the time it is tabled requires a supermajority. A majority is required to table a motion without killing it.  +
10. **You want to take a short break.** Move to recess for a set period of time.  +
11. **You want to end the meeting.** Move to adjourn.  +
12. **You are unsure that the chair has announced the results of a vote correctly.** Without being recognized, call for a â€œdivision of the house." At this point a standing vote will be taken.  +
13. **You are confused about a procedure being used and want clarification.** Without recognition, call for "Point of Information" or "Point of Inquiry." The chair will ask you to state your question and will attempt to clarify the situation.  +
14. **You have changed your mind about something that was voted on earlier in the meeting for which you were on the winning side.** Move to reconsider. If the majority agrees, the motion comes back on the floor as though the vote had not occurred.  +
15. **You want to change an action voted on at an earlier meeting.** Move to rescind. If previous written notice is given, a simple majority is required. If no notice is given, a supermajority is required.  +

Interruptions
--

You may *interrupt* a speaker for these reasons only:  +

* to get information about business - point of information
* to get information about rules - point of inquiry
* if you can't hear, safety reasons, comfort, etc. - question of privilege
* if you see a breach of the rules - point of order
* if you disagree with the chair's ruling - appeal

You may influence *what* the members discuss:  +

* if you would like to discuss something - motion
* if you would like to change a motion under discussion - amend

You may influence *how* and *when* the members discuss a motion:  +

* if you want to limit debate on something - limit debate
* if you want a committee to evaluate the topic and report back - commit
* if you want to discuss the topic at another time - postpone or lay it on the table
* if you think people are ready to vote - previous question
